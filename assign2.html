    Chandrapur <u>(earlier known as Chanda, the official name until 1964)</u> is a city and a municipal corporation in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra state, India. It is the district headquarters of Chandrapur district. Chandrapur is a fort city founded by <b>Khandkya Ballal Shah</b>, a Gond king of the 13th century. The city sits at the confluence of the<b>Erai river and Zarpat river</b>. The area around the city is rich in coal seams. Hence, Chandrapur is also known as the<b>"Black Gold City"</b> .

    The local people relate the name "Chandrapur" to the words Chandra (the moon) and pur (a settlement) after a legend. Scholars see the name as a derivative of <i>"Indupur"</i> (city of the moon) which stood near the Jharpat in the Treta Yuga.
